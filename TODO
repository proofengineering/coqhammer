1. Make boolean reflection work. Make CoqHammer usable with MathComp.

2. For reconstruction: look at the discrimination (also injection?)
   axioms used in the ATP proofs and add them to the context before
   invoking a reconstruction tactic.

3. Omit (some) type arguments (inductive type parameters?) to
   polymorphic functions/constructors (e.g. cons).

4. Omit (some) type guards when the type may be inferred (e.g. forall
   x : nat, Even(x) -> phi probably may be translated to forall x,
   Even(x) -> phi', because Even(x) implies nat(x)).

5. Heuristic monomorphisation (instantiation of polymorphic
   definitions with types).

6. Remove dependence on "grep".
